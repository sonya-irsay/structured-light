Structured light scanning involves projecting a known pattern of light onto a scene, and recovering scene geometry by analyzing distortions of the pattern.

This project is about developing utilities for capturing and reconstructing structured light scans, as well as sharing information related to structured light scanning for single-scan and real-time applications.

For an introduction to using these tools, check out the [Instructable](http://www.instructables.com/id/Structured-Light-3D-Scanning/).

# What is structured light 3D scanning? #

Structured light 3D scanning is about determining the 3D structure of a scene based on the distortion of the projected pattern. You might have seen it used for capturing Thom Yorke's face in the "[House of Cards](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nTFjVm9sTQ)" music video. [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_Light_3D_Scanner) has more info.
